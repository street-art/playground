# Jekyll/JavaScript test

This test tests JavaScript includes.

Jekyll provides variables like the page title, which is *{{ page.title }}*.

Jekyll can load JSON and provide it as variables, but it is not intended to load
JSON and process that data with JavaScript afterwards. Example (non-JSON) output of JSON file:

{{ site.data }}

Content can be modified with JavaScript: <div id="list"></div>

### Advantages

* Pages are easy to write (and easy to contribute to). Including files, images etc. is easy too.
* Generating the page is fast.
* GitHub Pages also uses Jekyll, so the page could be published there (no separate server and build runner needed).

### Disadvantages

* It is hard to use dynamic content like dynamic lists (for filtering).
A Framework like React would fit better for this purpose.
* By default, blog styles is used, pages are always on YYY/MM/DD/name.html without an explicit`permalink` entry.
